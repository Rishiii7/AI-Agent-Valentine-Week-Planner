## üåü Project Overview

The AI-Agent Valentine Week Planner is a sophisticated AI-powered application that creates the perfect Valentine's experience using multiple specialized AI agents built with the Agno Framework. The system combines a Gift Recommender Agent and a Day Planner Agent, to analyze personality traits, recommend personalized gifts, and plan the perfect Valentine's date - all while seamlessly integrating with Google Calendar for scheduling.

- **Deep Personality Analysis**: Leverages GPT-4o to analyze love languages, MBTI, hobbies, and preferences
- **Smart Gift Matching**: Connects personality insights with Walmart's product catalog via SerpAPI
- **Intelligent Date Planning**: 
  - Suggests optimal date venues and activities based on personality traits
  - Recommends perfect timing and duration
  - Automatically syncs with Google Calendar
- **Interactive Experience**: Streamlit-based interface for seamless user interaction
